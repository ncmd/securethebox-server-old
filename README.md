# securethebox-server
- Backend for securethebox app

## Developer Requirements
- git (Recommended to just install Github Desktop)
- Docker for Desktop
- nodejs 12.x & npm 6.x
- After you installed npm and nodejs, install these libraries globally
```
npm install -g npm-run-all
npm install -g cross-var
npm install -g commitizen
```

## Starting Service Locally
- Build docker image
```
docker build . -t securethebox-server
```
- Run docker image (service starts automatically)
```
docker run -it securethebox-server:latest /bin/bash
```

## Learning about this project
Git
- Refer to https://github.com/ncmd/git-scripted README.md for instructions how to contribute to a github repo
- .gitignore ignores files/folders that are added to it

Python
- mainly using python3.7 for all development

Docker
- Development is done using docker so that it can work in any infrastructure/host
- Look at the Dockerfile for details
- The host requires docker-engine (Docker for Desktop automatically installs this)
- Using python:3.7-slim docker image because it is flexible compared to alpine

Node/npm
- npm/nodejs is used for development to automate common command line tasks
- Docker should not need to utilize nodejs (at least for now)
- Read package.json script section to see all command line arguments
- Example npm commands:
```
npm run push-m = commit and push local master to ORIGIN remote master branch
npm run push-b = commit and push current branch to YOUR remote branch
npm run sync-l = sync YOUR local master branch with YOUR remote master branch
npm run sync-m = sync YOUR remote master branch with ORIGIN remote master branch
```

Spinnaker
- Service that will deploy helm charts

Minio
- Similar as AWS S3 as an open-source alternative as well as self hosted

Heroku
- This is provider that will host this app
- Hosting is pretty much free while developing

Google Kubernetes Engine
- This is the kubernetes cluster provider
